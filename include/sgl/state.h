	/// @brief Persistent GUI State Storage
	///
	/// This object allows for persistent GUI state storage for (ideally) a
	/// minimal information set saved from frame to frame. This provides a
	/// significantly more formal definition than the global state used in
	/// other toolkits written with more 'immediate mode' style.
	///
	/// These state objects are intended to allow various platforms to
	/// determine a memory management scheme, potentially eschewing heap
	/// allocation altogether. State objects are intended to be a function
	/// of prior state object and the current event. States are intended
	/// to be 'mostly' const - as the goal is to enforce a more functional
	/// paradigm for interaction.
